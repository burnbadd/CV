In the past few years of studying physics at Cambridge, I learned to investigate and solve problems using applied maths and programming, either from the course or in my free time. I would say that I am a critical thinker with a strong quantitative mind who enjoys working with like-minded people and is able to work independently in a fast-paced environment. I am looking to work in an environment that allows me to work on interesting and challenging real-life problems and to learn new mathematical/comp sci knowledge, which fits perfectly with this position. My skillset includes interdisciplinary knowledge and experience in Applied Mathematics, Physical Model development and Programming.
